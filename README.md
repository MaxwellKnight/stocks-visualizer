# Financial Dashboard App

This React app provides a financial dashboard that allows users to visualize and analyze financial data for different companies. It includes various components for displaying key financial metrics such as assets and liabilities, debt and cash equivalents, cash flow per share, net debt and free cash flow, returns, revenue and income, margins, cash, acquisitions, and shares outstanding.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the app, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/financial-dashboard-app.git

   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd financial-dashboard-app

   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install

   #or

   yarn
   ```

### Running the App

4. Run the app locally with the following command:

   ```bash
   npm start

   #or

   yarn start

   ```

   Open http://localhost:5173 in your web browser to view the app.

## CORS Issue

When running the app locally, you might face CORS issues, preventing the app from fetching data from certain APIs.

## Solution

To overcome CORS issues during development, you can use a Chrome extension that disables CORS. One such extension is "Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin."

### Instructions:

1. Install the "Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin" extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf).

2. Enable the extension while running the app locally.

3. Keep in mind that this extension should only be used for development purposes and should not be enabled while browsing other websites.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.

2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.

3. Start the app with `npm run dev`.

4. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:3000).
